# data-selection

1. Representation Algorighm (TBD)
2. Projection Algorithm
 * UMAP (recommended)
 * t-SNE
3. Clustering Algorithm
 * K-Means
 * DBSCAN
 * GMM
 * etc.
4. Other Algos
 * Nearest neighbors
 * various Coreset methods
 * https://github.com/PatrickZH/DeepCore

   Liangyu: there are many coreset selection methods. We would not exhaust them but will try to implement the typical ones of each category to catch the gist.
   Can we get the codebase of previous work?
