### Dataset

To download the datasets used in this project, run [this script](https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct/blob/main/scripts/data/prepare_train_data.sh). We used Alpaca, ShareGPT and WizardLM datasets for training and evaluation.

After downloading, datasets will be stored in the `data/processed` directory of the project.




### Coreset Selection
The hyperparameters and configurations are managed by [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/). The configurations are stored in `selection/config/`.
You should run the code by executing `main.py` in the `selection` directory. You can also specify the hyperparameters by command line arguments.
```bash
cd selection
python main.py data=[sharegpt|wizardlm] encoder=miniLM coreset=random
```
The selected indices are stored under `selection/indices/`.


### Finetuning
```bash
# Llama-2-7b-hf (with accelerate and deepspeed)
bash scripts/finetune_llama_with_accelerate.sh [INDICES]
```
Iterative selection is implemented in the `scripts/iter/` directory.

### Evaluation
```bash
bash scripts/eval/{eval}.sh
```
